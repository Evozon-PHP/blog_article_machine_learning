Magento:
1) Copy Magento2 folder contents into your magento base folder
2) Enable theme and module

Django:
1) To run the server, enter the command "python manage.py runserver" in the 'Django/mysite' folder
2) In the folder 'Django/mysite/search/files' I added some training data (since I removed the Products service)
3) All the Machine learning logic is in the folder 'Django/mysite/search/logic'... logically right ?

Have fun !
